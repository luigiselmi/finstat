    "Before an investment we have to look at the past of a company not just the last return, and also at its volatility, that is the variation of the price in time. There is a trade-off between return and risk: the higher the return the higher is the risk. One way to consider both is to look at the return-risk ratio, an indicator similar to the Sharpe ratio. The higher is the return-risk ratio the better. We may have the same ratio with different return and risk values, in that case the choise depends on the utility function of the investor, whether he or she is more or less risk averse. One other mathematical tool beyond mean return and volatility is the distribution of the past returns. We take the returns over a period, let's say a couple of years and we build the histogram of the returns. From the histogram we can see what is the probability, or frequency, of negative returns and the asimmetry, or skewness, of the distribution."
