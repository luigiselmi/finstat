    "## Net Present Value and Discounted Cash Flow\n",
    "The [video](https://www.coursera.org/learn/understanding-financial-markets/lecture/4BpZ0/how-much-is-a-company-worth-on-the-stock-market-part-1) (not very clear) is about \"discounting\". Discounting is a mechanism used in finance to estimate today's value of an amount of money to be received in the future. That is, it serves to answer question such as ''how much am I ready to pay to receive 100\\\\\\$ in one year?''. The amount you would pay is probably smaller than 100\\\\$. Suppose the promise of receiving 100\\\\\\$ in one year is worth 80\\\\\\$ today to you. Then your (yearly) discount rate is 25\\%. Indeed, by the mechanism of discounting (i.e. going backward in time) the **net present value** NPV of a future net cash flow R at at time period *t* is calculated as  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$NPV = \\frac{R_t}{(1 + r)^t}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where r is the rate of return that is paid on average for the same amount in a riskless investment, eg. treasury bonds, or the inflation rate. In the previous example the net cash flow after one year (t = 1) is R = 100 and r = 0.25 so that the present value is PV = 100/(1+25%) = 80\\\\\\$. Or equivalently, by the mechanism of compounding (i.e. going forward in time): 80 * (1+25%) = 100\\$. The discount rate *r* is influenced by two main factors: time and risk. As an example, let's say we plan to invest 150€ in a project that will last four years so that the initial cash flow is negative. We expect a net cash flow of 20€ the 1st year, 50€ the 2nd year, and 70€ the last two years. The rate of return paid by a bank for the same amount of money in the same periods is r = 10%. We can compute the net present value of the investment as follows\n",

    "When we want to compare the performances of two different financial instruments we compare the [net present value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_present_value) (NPV) of the two. Obviously we want instruments that have a positive NPV. Each financial instrument has a cash flow, money that enters (inflow) or leaves (outflow) at intervals of time. In order to make a comparison we have to discount the future cash flow to the present, that is, we have to calculate the value of the financial instrument and its cash flow at the present time. This calculation is easy to make when we deal with bonds or fixed income. For example we buy a bond for €1000 whose  annual interest rate is 10% that lasts 7 years and we want to compute the discounted cash flow at the present time. "

    "A government bond is issued by a state and gives the investor a predetermined stream of revenues (coupon) over a given period of time (maturity).

In the computation of this average of years, a higher weight is given to cash flows whose present values are higher. The exact weight of each cash flow corresponds to the relative weight of its present value compared to the present value of the whole bond (i.e. its price). For example, the time until the payment of the principal will get a relatively high weight in this average because the principal is normally a significantly larger cash flow than the coupons. However, we must not forget that the weights in this weighted average are proportional to the present value of each cash flow. Hence the principal, which is the last cash flow in the lifetime of the bond, will thus also be the one which is the most discounted and therefore its relative weight can be significantly reduced. Finally, duration is a key metric when evaluating the risk of a bond (or bond portfolio) when faced with changes in interest rates.\n",
