=======
This repository contains Jupyter notebooks about financial time series and portfolio optimization.
Models are used to represent processes that may contain a deterministic component, a seasonal or cyclical component, and a random component. Being able to represent these components would allow us to simulate the process starting from a data point that is not part of the observations, and to make predictions.
