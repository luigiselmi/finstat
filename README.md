This repository contains Jupyter notebooks about financial time series.
Models are used to represent processes that may contain a deterministic component, a seasonal or cyclical component, and a random component. Being able to represent these component allows us to simulate the process starting from a data point that is not part of the observation, and to make prediction.

## Time series models

### Random walk

### Moving average (MA)

### Autoregressive model (AR)
